# Projects


## Important Project Due Dates and Timeline
**I really encourage students to start thinking about project ideas early, ideally in the first week**. I am more than happy to chat about half-baked ideas, please reach out via Canvas or email to schedule a time.

General timeline:
1. Students will be expected to provide an email to the staff in the second week declaring their group, and a short description of a non-binding project idea.
2. Teams must schedule a meeting with the instructor during the third week to discuss the project.
3. Teams must write a final paper, due on the last day of class.
4. Teams must present a final project presentation, which will happen during the last two days of class (depending on enrollment).

For exact due dates, please see the [Schedule](schedule.md).

## Tips for Writing and Presenting

All papers must be provided in PDF format, using the class LaTeX template. I heavily reccomend using LaTeX, but students are allowed to use another writing method with permission from the instructor.

A useful Latex tutorial can be found here [here](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/).

There are a number of fantastic writing resources available. Personally, I found Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style” to be an excellent resource, and required only an afternoon of reading. Seriously, it’ll change your life.

For presenting, I encourage all who will listen to watch Patrick Winston’s legendary [How To Speak lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY). A [text adaptation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262360401/make-it-clear/) is available as well, which goes further into depth on many of the topics discussed.
