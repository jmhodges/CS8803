# Summary

**Security, Privacy, and Democracy** is an interdisciplinary research seminar with an emphasis on topics critical to a functioning democracy – voting systems, privacy, misinformation, censorship, and free and open communication. 

We will cover both current and foundational research in applied cryptography and systems security, as well as in economics, policy, and law. Invited speakers from industry, government, and civil society organizations will offer guest lectures. Students will read and discuss published research papers, present research findings, and complete an original research project.

Though there are no official prerequisites for this class, students are expected to be graduate students or advanced undergraduates interested in research in the area. **Papers may require mathematical maturity, and willingness to parse and study works from other disciplines**

# Course Outline
## Paper Summaries & Discussion Questions 
Every lesson will cover two papers on a specific subject. **For each paper assigned, due at midnight EST the day before each class** are:
1. A 1-2 paragraph summary of the paper, and 
2. two discussion questions for the paper.

Paper summaries should cover both the main contribution of the paper, the paper’s strengths, and --importantly-- its weaknesses. Discussion questions will be collated and covered in class. Summaries and discussion questions will be graded pass/fail.

## Weekly Presentations
Every week, a team of two will be assigned 20 minutes to present relevant research and policy developments that have come out since the assigned papers were published. Students presenting are exempt from that class’s Paper Summaries and Discussion Questions.

## Project
Students will form teams of 2-3 to do a research project centered around the topics covered in class. Teams will provide both a written final report and presentation of the work during the final weeks of the class. There is no page limit for the work, although a rough estimate might be 5-15 pages for a technical paper, formatted using the class template. Exemplar student works will be published online on the course website for future class’s reference.

Students will be expected to provide an email to the staff in the second week declaring their group, and schedule a meeting with the instructor during the third week to discuss the project.

Project presentations occur during the last two days of class (depending on enrollment).

## Grading
Grading is broken down as follows:
* [20%] Paper Presentation
* [30%] Paper Q&A  
* [50%] Final paper or project 

## Tips for writing and presenting
All papers must be formatted in latex, using the following class template: <Link to the template for the class>

There are a number of fantastic writing resources available. Personally, I found Strunk and White’s “The Elements of Style” to be an excellent resource, and required only an afternoon of reading. Seriously, it’ll change your life.

For presenting, I encourage all who will listen to watch Patrick Winston’s legendary [How To Speak lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY). A [text adaptation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262360401/make-it-clear/) is available as well, which goes further into depth on many of the topics discussed.
