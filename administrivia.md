### A note on generative AI:

Students may not use chatGPT or other generative AI tools to provide summaries of papers. Students *are* allowed to use these tools in their final papers, though they must submit a statement explaining which and how such tools were used, including applicable prompts.


## Course Expectations, Attendance & Participation:

This course will be conducted as in-person course. You are expected to attend all classes unless you have a compelling reason. Class announcements and information will be posted to email and Canvas. 

We will often have guest speakers attending the course. In order to encourage candid and frank discussion, unless otherwise specified by the speaker, these lectures will not be recorded, and will be held under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). 


## Technology Requirement:

You are REQUIRED to have and maintain access to Canvas, and Zoom, via your Georgia Tech sign-on information. Our general course materials and grades will be available on Canvas throughout the semester. If you have problems with registration (due to non-payment, etc.) you may be dropped from Canvas. It is imperative that you be proactive to avoid this situation. If you are in need of technical support, there are several new online tutorials and live technical Q&A opportunities available through Georgia Tech and Canvas. Please see me if you need additional technical support, so that I can help you find the appropriate resource through Georgia Tech. 


## Academic Integrity:

All students are assumed to have read the Code of Student Conduct and consented to be bound by it. Violations of these rules of conduct are taken extremely seriously, will be reported per applicable Georgia Tech policies, and will result in a failing grade for the course. 

For more information on the Honor Code and ethics at Georgia Tech, please visit:

## Special Accommodations:

If you require special learning/testing accommodations, please inform me at the beginning of the semester so that we can discuss and complete any necessary paperwork, and coordinate with Student Disability Services to ensure these accommodations are approved and documented officially. Georgia Tech complies with regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and offers accommodations to students with disabilities. If you are in need of a classroom accommodation, please make an appointment with the [Office of Disability Services](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/) to discuss the appropriate procedures.
